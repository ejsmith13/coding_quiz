# coding_quiz

For this project, I created a coding quiz website from scratch. This is the first site that I have incorporated javascript on, and it uses script to manipulate the DOM. I started with a fairly basic site. After I had the bones of my site created with html, I used javascript to make dynamic elements within the document. 

Once the start button is pressed, a series of questions with answer choices appear. Each question is added to the page and removed after an answer is chosen. If the question is answered correctly, 10 points are added to your score, but if you choose the wrong answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the built in timer. After all the questions are answered or you run out of time, you will be redirected to a highscores page. On this page, I used javascript to create dynamic input fields and buttons. I also used the local storage of the site to add the player's score to the highscores list and save it there. It can be cleared as well with the clear button.

This project helped me gain valuable experience with javascript. I am now able to add and remove elements to html with only script. The use of javascript also made the page much more interactive and interesting for the end user. I have inclued the links to the git reposity and deployed sites below, as well as a screenshot of the deployed site and highscores page.
